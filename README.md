# Updating the Flask Application for Professionalism

## Flask Application Structure:
- We'll utilize the Flask application factory pattern for better organization.
- Separate routes into a `routes.py` file.
- Move HTML templates and static files into appropriate directories.

## Code Modularity:
- Break down the functions into smaller, more manageable parts.
- Encapsulate related functionality into classes or modules.
- Add docstrings to functions for documentation.

## Styling:
- Add CSS styling to improve the appearance of the web pages.
- Ensure consistency in design and layout.

## Error Handling and Logging:
- Implement error handling to gracefully handle exceptions.
- Use logging to record errors and events for debugging purposes.

## Documentation:
- Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of code blocks.
- Provide a README.md file with instructions on how to run the project.

## Testing and Validation:
- Test the application thoroughly to ensure correctness and reliability.
- Validate user inputs and handle edge cases appropriately.
